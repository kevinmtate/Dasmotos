Codecademy Project for BWS Unit 2 Project Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts


Hi Codecademy reviewers! Wanted to "practice my github skills" but am pretty new to github so am not sure if this project is submitted correctly. Please let me know if there is anything you need to review this project or if I did this correctly or not. Thanks!

Also, I downloaded all the picture files locally just to practice linking with local file paths but this may be annoying when reviewing so let me know and I can update to the cloud links. Thanks!
